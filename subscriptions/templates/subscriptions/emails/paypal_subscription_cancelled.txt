{% load subscriptions %}Dear {% firstof user.customer.full_name user.customer.billing_address.full_name user.full_name user.email %},

As you may have heard, Blender Studio's subscription system recently got a new shiny update,
more on that in the blog post https://studio.blender.org/blog/subscription-system-update-2021/ .

Due to this update, the old PayPal Subscriptions payment method is no longer supported.
This means that PayPal's billing agreement that was used to pay for subscription #{{ subscription.pk }} has been cancelled,
and no more charges will be made until subscription's payment method is updated.

For this reason, we ask you to update the payment method using the following link:

    {{ site_url }}{% url "subscriptions:payment-method-change" subscription_id=subscription.pk %}

There you can choose to use the same PayPal account, however going through the process of updating the payment method is still necessary.

Subscription information:
-------------------------
Subscription #: 			{{ subscription.id }}
Renewal type: 			{{ subscription.collection_method }}
Renewal period: 			{{ subscription|renewal_period }}{% with taxable=subscription.taxable %}
Recurring total: 			{{ taxable.price.with_currency_symbol }}{% endwith %}
Payment method: 		PayPal Billing Agreement {{ billing_agreement_id }} (cancelled)
Last payment: 			{{ billing_agreement_last_payment_date|date }}
Payment due: 			{{ subscription.next_payment|date }}

In case you choose not to update the subscription, it will be cancelled a few weeks after payment due date.

We hope for your understanding and thank you for your continued support! ðŸ§¡
